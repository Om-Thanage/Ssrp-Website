        <p>The Somaiya Space Research Project (SSRP) established 16th January 2024, is a new research oriented student driven mega project at KJ Somaiya College of Engineering. This is our ambitious endeavor to expand the horizons of space exploration. As a team of passionate
students, we come together under one umbrella to pursue various research projects aimed at understanding the cosmos. Our collective goal is to develop and launch our very own satellite,
the KJSCE StudentSAT, into space, collaborating with esteemed institutions like ISRO and space startups along the way. Additionally, we actively engage in prestigious competitions such as the Spaceport America International Rover Challenge and CANSAT, where we showcase our innovation and teamwork on a global stage. Through our dedication toexploration, innovation, and outreach, we are poised to make meaningful contributions to
space research while embracing the challenges and growth that lie ahead.</p></div>

          <p className='item'>Future Goals</p>
          <p>In our pursuit to dominate the forefront of innovation and collaboration, we recognize the immense value of incorporating research-based projects alongside renowned competitions like the Spaceport America International Rover Challenge (IRC), CANSAT, and IROC-U (ISRO Robotics Challenge). 
Encouraging the team to share their research findings helps expand scientific knowledge and acknowledges their contributions. While the competitions offer a unique avenue for participants to delve deeper into specialized areas of problem solving and interest research based projects are vital for propelling the frontier of space exploration. The research  projects serve as catalysts for pushing the boundaries of what we understand about the universe, from studying celestial bodies to unraveling the mysteries of space phenomena. Moreover, they drive the development of cutting-edge technologies with applications far beyond the realms of space exploration. By engaging in these based projects we are not only solving existing challenges but also laying groundwork for further innovations and their long term sustainability.</p>
