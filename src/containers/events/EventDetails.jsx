    description: 'The trio conclave was organized in KJSCE, with the main objective of it being a brainstorming get-together, intended to foster a more vibrant and result-oriented collaboration between the Academia, and R&D Institutions. Collaboration among these three entities is vital and a game changer for the development of India, in line with Vikasit Bharat@2047. In addition to conferences, panel discussions, and presentations, there were stalls set up on the SVU Campus, in the Gargi Plaza highlighting various ventures and projects supporting the objectives of the conclave. One of these was that of or mega-project, Somaiya Space Research Project (SSRP) of KJSCE. We displayed our progress in this stall, where we also received guidance from the Director of Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Shri. Arumugam Rajarajan. The exposure and interactions, the team SSRP got through were invaluable. The event was concluded on 3 April 2024.',
